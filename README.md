# Freya-Ransomware-v1.0.1-Open-Source-

Freya Ransomware is a Proof of Concept and Open Source application. The person himself is responsible for illegal use, not the producer.

How do I use:

First of all, do not use the application on your own computer in folders where you have important files (such as C disk). You can cause irreversible damage to your files.

After opening Visual Studio you will see some variables in Global field. Here the directory variable represents the path to the folder to be encrypted. You can encrypt in that field by entering the folder path you want. As a matter of fact, that's how it is to be used.

Note:
It saves the encrypted key on the Desktop as Key.txt. You can undo the encryption by entering the same key. By the way, I have added the webhook function in it so that you can send it directly to the discord webhook without saving it to the desktop. You can activate it with a little editing.
